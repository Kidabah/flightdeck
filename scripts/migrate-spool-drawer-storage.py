"""Migrate FlightDeck spool storage to the six-drawer physical layout.

Creates 162 permanent drawer slots:
  D1..D6, three rows per drawer, nine positions per row.
Global spool positions run #1..#162.

Existing FlightDeck spool numbers are the physical drawer-home numbers. If a
spool has already been assigned into drawer storage, this migration normalises
it back to its matching numbered position. Spools that are currently loaded in
a printer, or visiting SUNLU, get their matching Home reserved without changing
their Current location. Legacy-stored spools that have not been assigned yet are
left alone for Fast Assign.

Drawer moves are also guarded at the database layer. Once a numbered spool is
sent to drawer storage, FlightDeck redirects it to the drawer position with the
same number, regardless of which older storage UI path initiated the move.

Also creates SUNLU Dryer as a temporary location. A small SQLite trigger keeps a
spool's home_storage_location_id unchanged while its current storage location is
SUNLU Dryer, so moving it back with the existing FlightDeck move path returns it
to its remembered drawer slot.

The migration is deliberately non-destructive. Existing Shelf #1/#2/#3
locations are archived only when no active spool currently uses them as either
current storage or home. Occupied legacy locations remain visible until those
spools have been assigned real drawer slots.
