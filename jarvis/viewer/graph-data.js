Ask her to **whistle** or **sing** anytime (voice or type) and she plays a real whistle melody (`viewer/sounds/amy-whistle.wav`). SFX lives in `jarvis/viewer/sounds/`: - `amy-whistle.wav` — on-demand whistle/sing - `amy-yawn.wav` — idle sleepy nudge While she's talking: say **stop** / **wait** / **hang on**, type it, or hit **STOP**.

Typing stop also works. **Mute** is the MIC/MUTE toggle — that turns the mic off entirely. Tune FINISH_MS after a day of real use — too low cuts you off, too high feels sluggish."

Amy talks to Flightdeck over HTTP (`flightdeck_base_url` in config). Amy never speaks MQTT to printers directly — Flightdeck owns printer control.
