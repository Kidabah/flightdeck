> A unified status, control, and telemetry dashboard for a mixed-fleet 3D printer farm.

Flightdeck is a self-hosted dashboard that brings disparate 3D printers — Klipper-based Vorons and Bambu Lab machines — under a single pane of glass. Instead of bouncing between Mainsail, Bambu Studio, and the printers' touchscreens, Flightdeck aggregates live status, exposes safe controls, and (eventually) presents a true "cockpit" view of the farm.

It's built primarily for my own bench (one Voron Greyhound Elite V2, a Bambu H2D, and a Bambu X1C), but the architecture is generic enough that anyone running a similar mixed fleet should be able to adapt it.

Project website files live in [`docs/`](docs/) for GitHub Pages.

New tester? Start with the plain-English setup guide: [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).

Flightdeck install is meant to be easy as 1-2-3:

1. Install Flightdeck.
2. Add printers from the Settings screen.
3. Add spools from the Spools screen.

---

## Safe Restart

If `systemctl restart flightdeck.service` hangs because old Bambu camera `ffmpeg` or `uvicorn` processes do not exit cleanly, use:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/safe-restart-flightdeck.sh
```

The helper stops the service, cleans only Flightdeck-owned leftover `uvicorn` and Bambu RTSP `ffmpeg` processes, starts the service again, and prints a compact `/api/printers` health check.

If only the camera feeds are misbehaving and the rest of Flightdeck is responsive, reset just the camera transcoders without restarting the app:

```bash
./scripts/clear-camera-workers.sh
```

The Setup health screen also reports the current Bambu camera worker count so duplicate stream workers are visible before they overload a Pi.

---

## Backup and Restore

Flightdeck code is backed up in the main GitHub repository. Live data is backed up separately so a clean install never overwrites your real printer history, spool inventory, uploads, or print vault.

Create a private backup archive and push it to:

```text
https://github.com/Kidabah/flightdeck-backup-private.git
```

```bash
./scripts/backup-flightdeck-data.sh
```

By default the backup includes:

- `flightdeck.db`
- `printers.yaml`
- `uploads/`
- `settings/`
- metadata files such as `backup_metadata.json` and `spools.db` when present

It deliberately excludes `.env`, SSH keys, virtual environments, caches, and the print vault. To include the print vault:

```bash
INCLUDE_PRINT_LIBRARY=1 ./scripts/backup-flightdeck-data.sh
```

To also copy the archive to the NAS staging folder:

```bash
BACKUP_STAGING_DIR=/mnt/flightdeck-backups/pi-imports ./scripts/backup-flightdeck-data.sh
```

If the NAS share is mounted elsewhere, replace `/mnt/flightdeck-backups/pi-imports` with the mounted path.

Restore from a backup archive:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop flightdeck.service
./scripts/restore-flightdeck-data.sh ~/flightdeck-backup-private/backups/flightdeck-backup-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.tar.gz
sudo ./scripts/safe-restart-flightdeck.sh
```

The restore helper asks you to type `RESTORE` and creates a safety copy of the current live data before it replaces anything.

## Why

Running multiple printers across ecosystems means juggling:

- **Klipper/Moonraker** for the Voron — rich API, fully open, but only knows about itself
- **Bambu's MQTT + cloud bridge** for the H2D and X1C — proprietary, less hackable, different paradigm entirely
- **OrcaSlicer / Bambu Studio** for slicing and (sometimes) monitoring
- Five web UIs, three apps, and a lot of context-switching

Flightdeck collapses that into one interface, owned by me, running on my network.

## Features

> Flightdeck is built in three tiers. Tier 1 is in active development; Tiers 2 and 3 describe the full vision.

### Tier 1 — Status Dashboard *(in development)*

- Live status from all printers in a single view
- Temperatures (hotend, bed, chamber where available)
- Print progress with time elapsed / time remaining
- Current file, layer, and toolhead position
- Webcam thumbnails / live streams
- MMU state for the Voron (gate, filament loaded, swap progress)
- Per-printer connection health and last-seen timestamps

### Tier 2 — Controls *(planned)*

- Start / pause / resume / cancel prints
- Pre-heat profiles and idle/sleep state machine
- Emergency stop with confirmation
- Filament load / unload / swap on the MMU
- Macro execution (PRINT_START, CUT_FILAMENT, calibration routines)
- Bed mesh visualisation and recalibration triggers
- AMS / external spool management for the Bambu side

### Tier 3 — Cockpit *(aspirational)*

- Cross-printer queue and scheduling
- Per-spool filament inventory with weight tracking
- Print history with searchable metadata (filament, profile, outcome)
- Failure detection and alerting (FlowGuard integration, Lidar errors, thermal anomalies)
- Energy monitoring per print
- Klipper input shaper / pressure advance history per machine
- A genuinely useful mobile view

### Stack

- **Backend:** Python 3.13 + FastAPI, async throughout
- **Storage:** SQLite (local, no Postgres dependency — this is a homelab tool)
- **Realtime:** WebSockets for push updates to the frontend
- **Bambu integration:** [`bambulabs-api`](https://github.com/mchrisgm/bambulabs_api) over MQTT
- **Klipper integration:** Moonraker JSON-RPC over WebSocket
- **Frontend:** React (Node 24 via nvm)
- **Host:** Raspberry Pi 5 with NVMe SSD, Debian 13 Trixie

### Design decisions

- **Pi 5, not the Voron's CB2.** Flightdeck runs on its own host so a dashboard bug or restart can never take down a printer mid-job. The Voron's CB2 stays dedicated to Klipper.
- **SQLite over Postgres.** Single-host, single-user, low write volume. The operational overhead of Postgres isn't worth it here.
- **FastAPI over Node.** A Replit prototype was built in TypeScript/Node/Express/Drizzle/Postgres and lives in the repo for reference, but the production path is Python — better fit for the Klipper/printer-tooling ecosystem the rest of the bench already runs on.
- **Local-first, no cloud.** No accounts, no telemetry leaving the network. Bambu's MQTT bridge is the only thing that touches the internet, and only because the X1C requires it.

## Installation

> **Status:** active homelab project. The default install keeps runtime data outside the git checkout so updates can be pulled cleanly.

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit on a Pi 5, or an equivalent Linux host
- Debian 13 (Trixie) or similar
- Python 3.13+
- Network reachability to all printers

Practical Pi sizing:

- Pi 5 4 GB: small installs, up to about 5 printers, lighter camera use
- Pi 5 8 GB: recommended default for more than 5 printers or several live camera feeds
- Pi 5 16 GB: bigger rooms, more than 10 printers, heavy camera use, demo/testing headroom
- Pi 4 4 GB: light installs should run, but expect less camera headroom

### Setup

For most Raspberry Pi installs:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kidabah/flightdeck/main/scripts/install-pi.sh | bash
```

That installs system packages, clones or updates Flightdeck, creates `.venv`, `.env`, the data directory, SQLite DB, uploads, print library, and systemd service.

Manual install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kidabah/flightdeck.git
cd flightdeck
./scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install-systemd.sh
```

Windows per-user tray install:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Kidabah/flightdeck.git
cd flightdeck
.\Install-Flightdeck-Windows.cmd
```

The Windows bootstrap checks for Python, Git, and ffmpeg, installs missing dependencies through `winget` when available, creates a local venv, stores live data under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Flightdeck`, and adds Flightdeck-branded Desktop/Startup shortcuts that run the tray launcher through `pythonw.exe`. Flightdeck then lives in the Windows hidden icons / notification area with menu actions for opening the dashboard, updating from GitHub, restarting, viewing logs, and exiting.

To install Windows with existing Flightdeck data, create a Pi backup archive and pass it to the installer:

```bash
INCLUDE_PRINT_LIBRARY=1 ./scripts/backup-flightdeck-data.sh
```

```powershell
.\scripts\windows\bootstrap-install.ps1 -DataArchive "C:\path\to\flightdeck-backup-YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS.tar.gz"
```

Uninstall the Windows tray app and shortcuts while keeping data:

```powershell
.\Uninstall-Flightdeck-Windows.cmd
```

Use `-RemoveData` only when you also want to delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Flightdeck`.

By default the installer stores live data in `~/flightdeck-data`:

- `flightdeck.db`
- `printers.yaml`
- `uploads/`
- `print_library/`

That keeps your printer config, queue/history database, uploaded files, and SD/library cache out of git. A fresh clone starts clean, and an existing install can pull updates without overwriting real data.

Run manually:

```bash
FLIGHTDECK_DATA_DIR=~/flightdeck-data .venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Install or update the systemd service for this checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install-systemd.sh
```

The dashboard will be available locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

For remote access, prefer Tailscale Serve:

```bash
tailscale serve --bg http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

This keeps Flightdeck off the raw LAN interface while exposing it over your tailnet HTTPS URL.

### Configuration

For normal installs, add printers in Flightdeck from **System -> Settings -> Printers** and add filament from **Spools**.

Advanced/manual option: printers are stored in the data directory's `printers.yaml`. The installer creates it from `printers.yaml.example` if it does not already exist.

```bash
$EDITOR ~/flightdeck-data/printers.yaml
```

Runtime paths can be overridden in `.env`:

```env
FLIGHTDECK_DATA_DIR=/home/flightdeck/flightdeck-data
# FLIGHTDECK_DB_PATH=/home/flightdeck/flightdeck-data/flightdeck.db
# FLIGHTDECK_UPLOADS_DIR=/home/flightdeck/flightdeck-data/uploads
# FLIGHTDECK_PRINTERS_CONFIG=/home/flightdeck/flightdeck-data/printers.yaml
# FLIGHTDECK_PRINT_LIBRARY=/home/flightdeck/flightdeck-data/print_library
```

### Migrating an Existing Pi Install

The portable migration script moves the live DB, printer config, uploads, and print library into `~/flightdeck-data`, then updates `.env`.

```bash
sudo systemctl stop flightdeck.service
./scripts/migrate-to-portable-data.sh
./scripts/install-systemd.sh
```

The script asks you to type `MIGRATE` before it moves anything.

### NAS / Docker Preview

Flightdeck can be staged on the ASUSTOR NAS with Portainer using the included Docker files.

Recommended NAS paths:

```text
/volume2/flightdeck-data      # 500 GB NVMe: DB, config, uploads, active data
/volume3/flightdeck-vault     # 2 TB NVMe: print vault
/volume3/flightdeck-backups   # 2 TB NVMe: backup archives
```

The preview stack is:

```text
docker-compose.nas.yml
Dockerfile
.dockerignore
```

The container maps:

```text
/volume2/flightdeck-data    -> /data
/volume3/flightdeck-vault   -> /print_library
/volume3/flightdeck-backups -> /backups
```

The NAS preview publishes Flightdeck on host port `8010` to avoid clashing with ASUSTOR/Portainer services that may already use `8000`.

The NAS compose also includes optional browser slicer sidecars using LinuxServer.io images:

```text
https://<nas-host>:3011  # OrcaSlicer
https://<nas-host>:3012  # Bambu Studio
```

OrcaSlicer stores its config in `/volume2/flightdeck-orcaslicer`, Bambu Studio stores its config in `/volume2/flightdeck-bambustudio`, and both mount the Flightdeck print vault at `/prints` so sliced files can be saved into the same NAS-backed library. Copy `.env.nas.example` to `.env` and set `ORCASLICER_PASSWORD` plus `BAMBUSTUDIO_PASSWORD` before starting the stack.

The OrcaSlicer and Bambu Studio browser images are currently x86-64 only, so run these sidecars on the NAS or another PC-class Docker host rather than the Raspberry Pi. Keep them behind Tailscale or trusted LAN access; the containers are full remote desktop-style apps, not public web services.

The NAS compose also marks the instance as Docker / Portainer managed so the setup health page does not expect a host `systemd` service inside the container.

For optional hardware support, the NAS Docker image includes `usbutils` and the compose file passes through `/dev/bus/usb` plus `/dev/hidraw0` so the Dymo scale and Brother QL-700 can be detected from inside the container.

This is intended for a staged NAS deployment first. Keep the Pi service as the live host until the NAS container has been tested with copied backup data and printer connectivity.

## Usage

Once running, open the dashboard in any browser on the local network. Printers should auto-connect and start streaming state within a few seconds. If one's offline, it'll show as unreachable rather than blocking the rest of the view.

There's no user account system — Flightdeck assumes you trust everyone on your LAN. If that's not true for your network, put it behind Tailscale or an authenticating reverse proxy.

## Flight Manual

### Demo Mode

Use **System -> Demo Mode** when showing Flightdeck to a tester or someone seeing it for the first time. It is a walkthrough surface that links into the real app without starting from risky controls.

For public or pre-install demos, use `/demo`. It loads the normal Flightdeck interface with a simulated API and WebSocket runtime, so the screens, navigation, and buttons feel like Flightdeck while real printer APIs and hardware commands stay untouched.

Demo mode uses static camera captures under `/static/demo-assets/` and simulated state. It does not start live camera workers or call printer media routes.

Recommended flow:

1. Start with **Dashboard** for fleet state, loaded filament, reliability, and camera access.
2. Open **Flight Tower** to show queue intelligence: ready jobs, blocked jobs, and why a printer is recommended.
3. Open one **Live** printer page to show the camera hero, status strip, print details, object exclusion, and filament route.
4. Open **Spools** to show inventory confidence, labels, cabinet view, and multi-spool grouping.
5. Open **Global Print Bay** to show printer storage, vault staging, compatibility badges, and safe queue actions.
6. Finish with **Maintenance** to show automatic Bambu care counters and manual per-printer tasks.

Avoid destructive controls during a casual walkthrough: E-stop, cancel, delete, archive, SD cleanup, and format actions should only be used deliberately.

### H2D Dual-Nozzle Colour Prints

For Bambu H2D jobs that use both nozzles, confirm the slicer has built the nozzle mapping before sending the job.

1. In Flightdeck, open the AMS slot and use **Trust Flightdeck** if the AMS profile/vendor/colour does not match the physical spool.
2. In OrcaSlicer or Bambu Studio, sync filament from the AMS.
3. Assign the model parts to the intended filament colours.
4. Use **Regroup and slice** if the send dialog shows the wrong nozzle grouping.
5. Confirm the send dialog shows the intended split, for example left nozzle using filament `1` and right nozzle using filament `5`.
6. Send the job once the filament/nozzle grouping matches the physical AMS setup.

If the slicer model has no geometry assigned to a colour, the send dialog may leave that nozzle blank even when Flightdeck and the AMS are correct.
